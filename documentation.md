# Documentation

## Purpose

- To facilitate quick onboarding and ensure that all team members can easily understand and contribute to new features.

## Key takeaways

- Clearly feature's scope.
- Show how it integrates within the larger system, highlighting essential services involved.
- Describe how the feature integrates with other systems.
- Outline steps to identify issues and narrow down problems.
- For developers: set up the development environment locally, debug, and troubleshoot.
- For testers: set up necessary test data.

## Details

- Problem Statement: **clearly define the problem the feature is addressing**. This gives everyone a **shared understanding of the feature's purpose and scope**.

- Overall architecture: offer a high-level view of the system architecture for the feature, including diagrams or descriptions to **show how it integrates within the larger system and highlighting essential components or services involved**.

- Communication flow: **describe how the feature integrates with other systems**. Detail the flow of communication, including APIs, message queues, or any external dependencies, to highlight the integration complexity.

- Flowchart for complex conditions: **if there are complicated conditions or decision points, use a flowchart to visually represent the process**. This simplifies understanding and helps prevent misinterpretations.

- Troubleshooting issues: **provide guidance on how to identify and resolve potential issues**. This could include common problems, logs to check, error messages, and steps to resolve them.

### Developer

- Environment setup and application start: describe the steps to set up the development environment, include any necessary configurations, dependencies, and instructions on how to start the application locally.
    - ✅ Provide an onboarding guideline for new team members: request roles, installation tools.
    - ✅ Provide a docker-compose file to simplify starting up dependencies.
    - ✅ Provide an API collection with guidelines for making call (including authentication, automation steps).

### Tester

- Creating test data: document the steps for setting up test data. Include any prerequisites, tools, or scripts necessary to simulate different scenarios for testing the feature.
    - ✅ Provide automation scripts to reduce repetitive steps when creating test data.
    - ✅ Provide details for integrated servers (e.g URLs, UI access, authentication).
