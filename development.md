# Development

## 1. Understand the `Why`

- As Software Development Engineers, it's easy to caught up in the technicalities of writing code, focus purely on structures, patterns and architectures. However, understand the `Why` behind your work is essential for **creating valuable product**.
- Knowing why a feature or change is needed helps shape your approach and ensures you're **solving real-world problems**, not just fulfilling requests. By understanding business needs, user pain points, and product vision, you can make more **strategic decisions that align with the company's goals**.
- The 'why' acts as a guiding compass, helping you **prioritize tasks and avoid unnecessary complexity**. It ensures you focus on features that provide real value to users and the business.
- Additionally, understanding the 'why' ensures that your work is aligned with the overall vision of the product. It allows you to **question assumptions, propose creative alternatives, and even push back on decisions when needed** – all in pursuit of building a better product.
- Without context, it’s easy to lose sight of the user experience and the business impact, leading to technically sound but ultimately irrelevant solutions.

## 2. Product mindset

- Think beyond implementation: you're not just writing code to meet requirements, you're **actively shaping the product's future**. Understand how your contributions align with the overall product vision.
- Contribute to the vision: each feature you build should support the product's long-term goals. **Think about how it will impact users and fit into the bigger picture**.
- Take pride in your work: own the quality of your contributions. **Your code plays a key role in the product's success and evolution**.
- Think Holistically: approach your tasks as part of the larger product ecosystem, **making decisions that benefit both the feature and the product overall**.
- Embrace responsibility: **take responsibility for the product's outcome**. If something goes wrong, own the solution and learn from it.
